The Inversed Scala Workshop @ WarsJawa 2013
===========================================

This will contain materials for the workshop I'll be hosting at http://WarsJawa.pl this year.

Expect this workshop to be... **inversed**! Wat!?

Wait and see... :-)

Inversed?
---------
Yes. Because instead of using framework X, we will take a look at it, and then reimplement it (a small part), 
and learn all the required language constructs as we need them!

Don't learn by the order in some book... learn in the order you need to!
